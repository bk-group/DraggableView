# DraggableView

This is a Music Player example of Youtube's Draggable Minimizing Video Playback Screen. It uses Motion layout for recreating the UI behavior

I have written a [https://medium.com/@suchandrimsarkar/youtube-like-drag-minimizable-view-using-motionlayout-ca2fb40d8483](Medium Post) which explains how this Library works and what each component does.

This is NOT a Library, rather a demo. You can download the project and make your changes as required. Since each component in the player has to be individually animated, trying to make it a library will make it overly complicated
