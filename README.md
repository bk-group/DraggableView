# DraggableView
This is a Music Player example of Youtube's Draggable Minimizing Video Playback Screen. It uses Motion layout for recreating the UI behavior

This is NOT a Library, rather a demo. You can download the project and make your changes as required. Since each component in the player has to be individually animated, trying to make it a library will make it overly complicated

I am working on a Medium Post which will explain the code and the implementation. Once that is done, I will attach a Link right here
